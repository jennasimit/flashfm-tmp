Package: flashfm
Title: flexible and shared information fine-mapping
Description: Flashfm is a computationally efficient approach to simultaneously 
	     fine-map several related quantitative traits and borrows information 
	     between diseases in a Bayesian framework. Joint models that 
	     have at least one shared causal variant between a pair of 
	     traits are given higher weight than those without shared 
	     variants. Flashfm has greater accuracy than single trait analysis 
	     when shared causal variants exist, and negligible loss of 
	     precision otherwise. The best SNP models are summarised in terms of
             sets of correlated SNPs that have a similar impact on the
             trait.
