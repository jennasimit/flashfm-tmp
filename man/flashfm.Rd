\title{Marginal PP for models of a set of traits, sharing information between the traits}
\usage{
flashfm(main.input, TOdds, covY, ss.stats, cpp = 0.99, maxmod = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{main.input}{List of 3 components: SM=list of snpmod objects for a set of traits; mbeta=list of joint effects for each trait; nsnps= number of SNPs in the region 
This could be obtained from flashfm.input or JAMexpanded.multi.}

\item{TOdds}{Vector of target odds of no sharing to sharing}

\item{covY}{trait covariance matrix}

\item{ss.stats}{output from summary.stats; list of 4 components: Mx = mean of SNPs, xcovo = covariance matrix of SNPs, Sxy = matrix of Sxy values (column traits), ybar=vector of trait means}
}
\value{
List consisting of PP: marginal PP for models and MPP: marginal PP of SNP inclusion
}
